# PapyAPI
PapyAPI is a minecraft paper plugin for accessing a server over a network.  
***This plugin is insecure, anyone can send requests to the server
without any authentication. USE THIS ON A LOCAL NETWORK ONLY!!!***  
# Use case
PapyAPI is a great tool if you want to run a script to generate something
on a local server, e.g. one could run a script to fetch the time and generate
the text on the server.
